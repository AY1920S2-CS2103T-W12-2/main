[qanda]
How do I transfer my data to another Computer? ::
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Address Book folder.

How do I transfer the information in TeaPet to the co-form teacher? ::
Right now, TeaPet does not support the transfer of data, but the feature will be coming soon in the near future.

Why can't I see my personal scheduler from a while ago? ::
To see the schedule for a specific week, you could use the command `schedule view mode/weekly date/DATE`, where date is
one of the date in the week you are seeking for.

How do I retrieve back all the class list in TeaPet if I accidentally cleared all the content? ::
Right now TeaPet does not support a backup feature, hence it would be best if you do not accidentally use the clear
command. The backup feature will be coming soon in the near future.

TeaPet is not working on my computer. How do I fix it? ::
Ensure that your computer is running on Java 11 and not other versions. TeaPet does not support other versions of Java.
