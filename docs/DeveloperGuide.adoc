== Introduction

Welcome to TeaPet!

image::Ui.png[width="790"]

TeaPet is an integrated platform fully customized for Form Teachers in Primary, Secondary and Tertiary institutions to help them manage their classroom effectively.
It contains their personal curriculum schedule, students' particulars, and can also track their class' academic progress.

All their important information is comfortably compartmentalized on our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI) and we are optimized for users who are very comfortable
working on the Command Line Interface (CLI).

If you are looking for a way to easily manage your administrative classroom chores
and have quick hands, then TeaPet is definitely for you!

== About
The aim of this Developer Guide is to provide an introduction to the software architecture and implementation of TeaPet.
It is made for developers who wish to understand and maintain the backbone of our application.

At TeaPet, we prioritise teamwork. We welcome you developers to contribute and improve on our application anytime by
opening an issue should you have any refreshing ideas to improve TeaPet after reading this guide.

== How To Use
This section will teach you how should you go about understanding our Developer Guide in order to best understand our product.

Reading ahead, you will find that we've adopted the "top-down" approach into the structure of our Developer Guide --
We will first look at the high-level architecture of our application before delving into the implementation details of each feature that makes up TeaPet.

We encourage you to read every page diligently from the top to the bottom in order to get the highest level of understanding of our application.
If you are only interested in how we develop one feature, you may read the high-level design then focus on the implementation of that particular feature.

== Design


[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This section describes the high-level software architecture of TeaPet.

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/tree/master/docs/diagrams[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name} Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `{Entity Name} student delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `student delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's UI Component.

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `NotesPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` and `HelpWindow`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Logic Component.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `TeaPetParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a student).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `UI`,and then displayed to the user.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `UI` to perform certain actions.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("student delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `student delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `StudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Model Component.

.Structure of the Model Component with `Student` class as a detailed example.
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the data of different Entities.
* stores in-memory data of Students, Admin, Academics, Notes and Events.
* exposes multiple unmodifiable `ObservableLists` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.



[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component
This section describes the high-level software structure of TeaPet's Storage Component.

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-W12-2/main/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* converts Model objects into savable data in JSON-format and vice versa.
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can store `Students`, `Admin`, `Academics`, `Notes` and `Events` in a several json files, which can be read.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

//@@author TheElectricBlender
//tag::particulars-feature[]
=== Student particulars feature
The student particulars feature keeps track of essential student details.
The feature comprises of commands namely,

* `StudentAddCommand` - Adds the student particulars into the class list
* `StudentEditCommand` - Edits the particulars of a student
* `StudentDeleteCommand` - Deletes the student information
* `StudentFindCommand` - Finds information of the required student
* `StudentClearCommand` - Deletes all student details from the student list


The student commands all share similar paths of execution and is illustrated in the following sequence diagram below,
which shows the sequence diagram for the StudentAddCommand.

The commands when executed, will interface with the methods exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations
(See <<Design-Logic,logic component>> for the general overview).

.Sequence Diagram for StudentAddCommand
image::student_sequence_diagram_v1.png[]

{nbsp} +

*These are the common steps among the Student Commands:*

1. The `TeaPetParser` will assign the `StudentCommandParser` to parse the user input.

2. The `StudentCommandParser#parse` will take in a string of user input consisting of the arguments.

3. The arguments are tokenized and the respective models of each argument are created.



[[Feature-Add]]
==== Student Add command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentAddCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which validates the student defined.


2. As student names are unique, if a duplicate student is defined, a `CommandException` is thrown which will not add the defined student.

3. The method `Model#addStudent(Student student)` will then be called to add the student. The command box will be reflected with
the `StudentAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.
[NOTE]
If the format or wording of adding a student contains error(s), the behaviour of TeaPet will be that
either a unknown command or wrong format error message will be displayed.

4. The newly created student is added to the `UniqueStudentList`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `student add` command:

.Activity Diagram for StudentAddCommand
image::StudentAddActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Student Edit command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentEditCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks
if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the `StudentEditCommand(Index, index, EditStudentDescriptor editStudentDescriptor)`
constructor. It uses the `StudentEditCommand.EditStudentDescriptor` to create a new edited student.


2. A new `Student` with the newly updated values will be created which replaces the existing `Student` object using the
`Model#setStudent(Student target, Student editedStudent)` method.

3. The filtered student list is then updated with the new `Student` with the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` method.

4. The command box will be reflected with the `StudentEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the success message.

==== Student Delete command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentDeleteCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the `Index`
is defined as an argument when instantiating the `StudentDeleteCommand(Index index)`  constructor. +
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of the student list. +

2. The `Student` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueStudentList#students` observable list using the
`Model#deleteStudent(Index index)` method.

3. The command box will be reflected with the `StudentDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

==== Student Find command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentFindCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `StudentFindCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the
`NameContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords)` is defined as part of the argument when instantiating the
`StudentFindCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` constructor.

2. The `Student` is then searched through the `UniqueStudentList#students` list using the `Model#hasStudent(Student student)` method
to check if the `Student` already exists. If the `Student` does not exist, a `StudentNotFoundException` will be thrown and the `Student` will not be displayed.

3. The existing `UniqueStudentList#internalList` is then cleared and updated using the `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate predicate)`
method.

4. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

==== Student Clear command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `StudentFindCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of the user input, the `StudentClearCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

2. The `Model#setTeaPet(ReadOnlyTeaPet teaPet)` method is then called which triggers the `TeaPet#resetData(ReadOnlyTeaPet newData)` method
and creates a brand new student list to replace the old one.

3. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Syntax
* *Current Implementation:*

** Current implementation of the feature follows just the command word syntax
For example, `student`.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using the forward slash `/` before the command word, for example `/add`. However, we realise that it is redundant
and will make inputs more tedious and confusing for users.



===== Aspect: Command Length:
* *Current Implementation:*
** Commands are shortened as much as possible without much loss in clarity. For example, instead of using `/temperature`, we used
`/temp` instead to input the students temperature into the application. Although this may be initially unfamiliar to users, it
should be easy to pick up and make it less tedious during input.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using more descriptive arguments such that arguments are clear and succinct. However, this will definitely decrease
the user expereince as the command will be too long to type.


==== Import image feature

This feature was included in TeaPet to help teachers easily identify the students using their pictures instead of just names.
This feature utilises the `StudentCard#updateImage` method to update the images of students.


The feature comprises of one command namely, `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand`

* Refreshes the student list to show updated images of students and displays the student list.


This is further illustrated in the following sequence diagram below.


.Sequence Diagram for `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand`
image::ImportImage.v1.png[]

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `DefaultStudentDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called. It does not
require validation as it does not write into the student list.

2. The `StudentCardDefault#updateImage` method is then called which checks the image folder for the required png file and updates
the student card.
[NOTE]
The name of the png file must match the name of the student.

3. If any view other than the student list view is showing on the `MainWindow`, the `MainWindow#handleDefaultStudent()` method
will be called and the student list is now visible on the `MainWindow`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `student` command:


.Activity Diagram Import Image Feature
image::ImportImageSequenceDiagram.png[]

{nbsp} +

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Syntax
* *Current Implementation:*

** Current implementation of the commands follows the command word syntax, followed by the arguments necessary for execution.
For example, `student add/edit/delete/find`.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** We considered using a whole new command, `student refresh` to solely refresh and update images of the students. However, we realised
that it would be more convenient for the user if we just add this functionality into the `student` command instead as it is able to
both update the images and display the student list concurrently.

//tag::admin[]
=== Class administration feature
The class administration feature keeps track of essential student administrative details.
The feature comprises of four commands namely.

The structure of the Admin commands are as shown below:

.Class Diagram for Admin Commands
image::AdminClassDiagram.png[]

The student administrative feature keeps track of essential student admin details. The feature comprises of commands namely,

* `AdminDisplayCommand` - Displays the most updated class administrative details.
* `AdminDatesCommand` - Displays the dates that hold administrative information of the class.
* `AdminSaveCommand` - Saves today’s administrative information of the class.
* `AdminDeleteCommand` - Deletes the administrative information of the class at the specified date.
* `AdminFetchCommand` - Fetches the administrative information of the class at the specified date.

==== Admin Display Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminDisplayCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which does not take in any arguments.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` will then be called to update the
filtered student list to show all current students in the student list.


[NOTE]
If the class list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

*Step 3*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the wording of the `AdminDisplayCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command message will be displayed.

==== Admin Dates Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminSaveCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDatesCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which does not take in any arguments.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredDateList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_DATES)` will then be called to update the
filtered date list to show all current dates in the date list.

[NOTE]
If the date list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

*Step 3*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminDatesCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of the `AdminDatesCommand` command contains error(s), an unknown command or a wrong format message
will be displayed.

==== Admin Save Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AdminSaveCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminSaveCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in today's date as an argument.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` will then be called to update the
filtered student list to show all current students in the student list.

*Step 3*. Sequentially, a date constructor will then called, creating a date object with today's date and
`Model#getFilteredStudentList()`

*Step 4*. The method `Model#addDate(Date date)` will then be called to add the date. This will then trigger the
`UniqueDateList#addDate(Date toadd)` method, which will throw `DuplicateDateException` if the date that is been added
exists, with the duplicate dates error message.

*Step 5*. The command box will be reflected with the `AdminSaveCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `AdminSaveCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command or wrong format error message will be
displayed.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes AdminSaveCommand:

.Activity Diagram for AdminSaveCommand
image::AdminSaveActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Which date to save

* **Current Implementation:** Saves the most updated administrative list as today's date.
** Pros: Easy to implement and prevents mutation of dates.
** Cons: The user will be unable to overwrite dates.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Saves the most updated administrative list as any date.
** Pros: The user can mutate any dates as he or she wishes.
** Cons: Hard to implement, and possible accidental mutation of dates.

====== Aspect: Allow overwriting of data

* **Current Implementation:** Saving a date that exists in the storage is not allowed.
** Pros: Easy to implement and prevent accidental mutation of data
** Cons: Hard to implement.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Saving a date that exists in the storage is allowed.
** Pros: User can make necessary changes to the dates where errors exists.
** Cons: Hard to implement and could result in accidental mutation of dates.

==== Admin Delete Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `admin save` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AdminDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a
DateContainsKeywordsPredicate object as an argument. User input will be parsed first to a DateContainsKeywordsPredicate
object before passing to the`AdminDeleteCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
Date is to be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a ParseException will be thrown and an error message will be displayed.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(DateContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` will then be called to
update the filtered date list to show the date that matches the given predicate. If no such date is found after
searching through the `UniqueDateList#dates`, a DateNotFoundException will be thrown with an error message displayed.

*Step 3.* After the date has been found, the method `Model*deleteDate(Date target)` will then be called to remove the
specified date from `UniqueDateList`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

.Admin Delete Sequence Diagram
image::AdminDeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Admin Fetch Command

*Step 1*. The `AdminFetchCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a
DateContainsKeywordsPredicate object as an argument. User input will be parsed first to a DateContainsKeywordsPredicate
object before passing to the`AdminFetchCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
Date is to be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format, or a ParseException will be thrown and an error message will be displayed.

*Step 2*. The method `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(DateContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` will then be called to
update the filtered date list to show the date that matches the given predicate. If no such date is found after
searching through the `UniqueDateList#dates`, a DateNotFoundException will be thrown with an error message displayed.

[NOTE]
The sequence diagram for `admin fetch` command is similar to that of `admin delete` command.
//end::admin[]

=== Student Academics feature
This student academics feature stores and tracks the class' academics progress.
The academics feature consists of four commands namely.

* `AcademicsCommand` - Displays the most updated student academics details.
* `AcademicsAddCommand` - Adds a new assessment to the academic list.
* `AcademicsEditCommand` - Edits the details of a particular assessment.
* `AcademicsDeleteCommand` - Deletes the specified assessment from academics.
* `AcademicsSubmitCommand` - Submits students' work to the specified assessment.
* `AcademicsMarkCommand` - Marks students' work of the specified assessment.
* `AcademicsDisplayCommand` - Displays either homework, exam, or the report of student academics.
* `AcademicsExportCommand` - Exports the academics information into a .csv file.

All academics commands share similar paths of execution. The commands when executed, will interface with the methods
exposed by the `Model` interface to perform the related operations (See <<Design-Logic,logic component>> for the general overview).

.Class Diagram for Academics Commands

==== Class Overview
The class diagram below will depict the structure of the Academics Model Component.

.Class Diagram for Academics Model
image::academics/AcademicsModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Academics Add Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsAddCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a necessary assessment
description, type and date.
[NOTE]
Format for adding an assessment is `academics add desc/ASSESSMENT_DESCRIPTION type/TYPE date/DATE`.

*Step 2*. As assessment names should be unique, the `Model#hasAssessment(Assessment assessment)` method will check if
the assessment already exists in `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`. If a duplicate assessment is found, a
`CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 3*. Subsequently, the `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` method will then be called, to set the student submission
tracker for the assessment.

*Step 4*. The method `Model#addAssessment(Assessment assessment)` will then be called to add the assessment. The
command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be
returned with the message.

[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `AcademicsAddCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command or wrong format error message
will be displayed.

The following sequence diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AcademicsAddCommand:

.Academics Add Command Sequence Diagram
image::academics/academics_add_command_sequence_diagram.png[]

==== Academics Edit Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsEditCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edits the details of the specified
assessment. The method checks if the `index` defined when instantiating
`AcademicsEditCommand(Index index, EditAssessmentDescriptor editAssessmentDescriptor)` is valid. Since it is optional
for users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `Assessment` object.
[NOTE]
User needs to input at least 1 field of assessment to edit.

*Step 2*. A new `Assessment` with the newly updated values will be created which replaces the existing `Assessment`
object using the `Model#setAssessment(Assessment target, Assessment editedAssessment)` method. However, if new
assessment results in a duplicate assessment in `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 4*. The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

==== Academics Delete Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsDeleteCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which deletes the assessment at the
specified index. It checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the `AcademicsDeleteCommand`
constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. The `Assessment` at the specified `Index` is then removed from `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments` observable
list using the `Model#delete(Assessment assessment)` method.

*Step 3.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

==== Academics Submit Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsSubmitCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsSubmitCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which submits students' work for the
assessment at the specified index. The method checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument when instantiating the
`AcademicsSubmitCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. Subsequently, the `Model#hasStudentName(String studentName)` method will then check if the given student
exists in `UniqueStudentList#students`. Also, `Model#hasStudentSubmitted(String studentName)` method checks if the
student has already submitted their work for the specified assessment. If the student does not exist or has already
submitted their work, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

*Step 3*. The students' `Submission` will then be submitted to the specified `Assessment` using the method
`Model#submitAssessment(Assessment assessment, List<String> students)`.

*Step 4.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsSubmitCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an AcademicsSubmitCommand:

.Academics Submit Activity Diagram
image::academics/AcademicsSubmitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Academics Mark Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsMarkCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsMarkCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which marks students' work and stores the
students' scores for the assessment at the specified index. The method checks if the `Index` is defined as an argument
when instantiating the `AcademicsMarkCommand` constructor.
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of `UniqueAssessmentList#assessments`.

*Step 2*. Subsequently, the `Model#hasStudentName(String studentName)` method will then check if the given student
exists in `UniqueStudentList#students`. Also, `Model#hasStudentSubmitted(String studentName)` method checks if the
student has yet to submit their work for the specified assessment. If the student does not exist or has not submitted
their work, a `CommandException` will be thrown. Furthermore, the score should be between 0 and 100 inclusive,
otherwise `CommandException` will also be thrown.
[NOTE]
Format for marking a students' work is `academics mark INDEX stu/STUDENT_NAME-SCORE`.

*Step 3*. The students' `Submission` will then be marked and its score will be stored in the specified `Assessment`
using the method `Model#markAssessment(Assessment assessment, List<String> students)`.

*Step 4.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsMarkCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

===== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Allow submission along with marking

* **Current Implementation:** Marking a submission that has not be submitted is not allowed.
** Pros: Clearer and prevents confusion in data.
** Cons: Harder to implement and the user will have to submit students' work separately.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Marking an unsubmitted work will also submit it for the assessment.
** Pros: The user can just submit students work using the mark command, giving them less to type.
** Cons: Prone to confusion of submitting and marking commands.

===== Aspect: Allow customizable total score of assessments

* **Current Implementation: ** Setting the total score for a submission is not allowed. (Total score for all submissions will be 100.)
** Pros: Easy to implement and maintains uniformity of data.
** Cons: User cannot set different total scores for assessments and have to grade it to a 100 weightage.

* **Alternatives Considered:** Setting the total score for a submission is allowed.
** Pros: User can make set different total scores to different assessments according to its requirements.
** Cons: Hard to implement and could result in inconsistency of data.

==== Academics Display Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsDisplayCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsDisplayCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which can either take in no arguments
or a 1 word argument indicating the type of display to show.

[NOTE]
Other than the default display (no arguments needed), there are only 3 types of displays: `homework`, `exam`, and
`report`. +
Format: `academics` or `academics DISPLAY_TYPE`

*Step 2*. Depending on the display type, the command box will reflect its respective `AcademicsDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS`
constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message. +
Example. `homework` type display will reflect `AcademicsDisplayCommand#MESSAGE_HOMEWORK_SUCCESS`

[NOTE]
If the academics list is empty, a blank page will be shown.

[NOTE]
If the wording of the `AcademicsDisplayCommand` contains error(s), an unknown command message will be displayed.

==== Academics Export Command

===== Implementation
The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `AcademicsExportCommand` performs.

*Step 1*. The `AcademicsExportCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which exports the content of Academics
into a csv file in the data folder.
[NOTE]
Format of the command is: `academics export`.

*Step 2.* The command box will be reflected with the `AcademicsExportCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new
`CommandResult` will be returned with the message.

*Step 3.* Subsequently, the `CommandResult` will be processed by the `MainWindow` in the UI component and generate a
studentAcademics.csv in the data folder of the current directory.

=== Notes feature
TeaPet application comes with an in-built notes feature, which serves to allow Teachers to record administrative or behavioural
information of his/her students. Each note is tagged to a specific student and acts as a lightweight, digital 'Post It'.

The notes feature comprises of 6 main functionalities represented by 6 commands. They are namely: +

* `NotesCommand` - Displays all notes and help on the notes feature.
* `NotesAddCommand` - Adds a new note into TeaPet.
* `NotesEditCommand` - Edits the details of a note in TeaPet.
* `NotesDeleteCommand` - Deletes a note in TeaPet.
* `NotesFilterCommand` - Filters the list of notes in TeaPet based on user-input keywords.
* `NotesExportCommand` - Exports all notes information into a .csv file

==== Structure of Notes Class
Notes object is made up of 4 fields. They are namely: Student Name, Content, Priority and DateTime. The class diagram below
depicts the structure of the Notes Model Component.

.Class Diagram for Notes Model Component
image::developerguide/notes/NotesModelClassDiagram.png[]

==== Add Note
The following is a detailed elaboration how `NotesAddCommand` operates.

[NOTE]
Format for adding a Note is `notes add name/STUDENT_NAME cont/CONTENT pr/PRIORITY`.
[NOTE]
Priority can only be either LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, case-insensitive.

*Step 1*. The `NotesAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which takes in a necessary student name, content and priority as input

*Step 2*. The note is then searched through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list using the
 `Model#hasNote(Notes note)` method to check if the note already exists. If the note exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate note error message.

*Step 3*. The method `Model#addNote(Notes note)` will then be called to add the note. The command box will be reflected with
the `NotesAddCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.
[NOTE]
If the format or wording of `NotesAddCommand` contains error(s), the behaviour of NotesManager will be similar to step 2, where either a unknown command
or wrong format error message will be displayed.

.Supplementary Frame for Sequence Diagram
image::developerguide/notes/SDGetNotesAddCommand.png[]

==== Edit Note

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesEditCommand` performs.

[NOTE]
Format for adding a Note is `notes edit INDEX [name/UPDATED_STUDENT_NAME] [cont/CONTENT] [pr/PRIORITY]`.
[NOTE]
Priority can only be either LOW, MEDIUM or HIGH, case-insensitive. Enclosing [] braces indicate optional fields.
At least one of the three fields must be present.

*Step 1*. The `NotesEditCommand#execute(Model model)` method is executed which edit attributes of the selected note. The method
checks if the `index` defined when instantiating `NotesEditCommand(Index index, EditNotesDecriptor editNotesDescriptor)` is
valid. Since it is optional for users to input fields, the fields not entered will reuse the existing values that are currently stored and defined
in the `Notes` object.

*Step 2*. A new `Notes` with the updated values is created and it is then searched  through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list using the
 `Model#hasNote(Notes note)` method to check if the note already exists. If the note exists, the `CommandException` will be thrown
with the duplicate note error message.

*Step 3*. The newly created `Notes` will replace the old one through the `Model#setNote(Notes toBeChanged, Notes editedNote`
method.

*Step 4*. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesEditCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will be returned with the message.


==== Delete Note

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesDeleteCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesDeleteCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the `Index`
is defined as an argument when instantiating the `NotesDeleteCommand(Index index)`  constructor. +
[NOTE]
The `Index` must be within the bounds of the student list. +

2. The `Notes` at the specified `Index` is then removed from the `UniqueNotesList#notes` observable list using the
`Model#deleteNote(Index index)` method.

3. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesDeleteCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

.Activity Diagram for Deleting Note
image::developerguide/notes/NotesDeleteActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Filter Notes

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesFilterCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesFilterCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which checks if the
`NotesContainsKeywordsPredicate(keywords)` is defined as part of the argument when instantiating the
`NotesFilterCommand(NotesContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` constructor.

2. The `Notes` is then searched through the `UniqueNotesList#notes` list... ...

3. The existing `UniqueNotesList#internalList` is then cleared and updated using the `Model#updateFilteredNotesList(Predicate predicate)`
method.

4. A new `CommandResult` will be returned with the success message.

==== Export Notes

The following is a detailed explanation of the operations which `NotesExportCommand` performs.

1. After the successful parsing of user input, the `NotesExportCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called.

2. The command box will be reflected with the `NotesExportCommand#MESSAGE_SUCCESS` constant and a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

3. The `MainWindow` of the UI component will process the `CommandResult` and create a studentNotes.csv in the data folder of
the current directory.

===== Design Considerations
* Current Implementation: Intuitive, simple syntax and user-friendly
- Pros: It is easy for the Teacher to use the feature.
- Cons: Not as powerful and less utility for advanced users.

* Alternatives Considered: Many additional fields including special tags, reminders, etc.
- Pros: Powerful, many interesting features that advanced users can use.
- Cons: It contradicts with the initial goal of the Notes feature which is to enable quick and easy note-taking.

=== Schedule feature

==== Overview

The schedule feature enables teachers to add, delete, edit and view events in their personal scheduler. This feature is built
based on the Jfxtras iCalendarAgenda library. The iCalendarAgenda object is used on the UI side to render VEvents. The VEvent
object takes in data such as event name, start date time, end date time, recurrence of events, etc.

[NOTE]
VEvent object is used primarily throughout the application as it is the required object type for the iCalendarAgenda library.
Hence, at the storage level, the Event objects are mapped to VEvents for reading purposes and vice versa for saving purposes.

The feature comprises of the the following commands:

* `EventAddCommand` - Creates a new event.

To add:

==== Class Overview

The class diagram below shows the interactions between events classes in the `Model`. Notice how the `EventHistory` class depends
on the `Event` class in its constructor but only has a `VEvent` attribute. This is because an `Event` object will always be
mapped to a `VEvent` within the `EventHistory` class. Some methods of `EventHistory` has been omitted for brevity as they are
mostly `VEvent` based, which then again highlights that the interactions with the `Logic` and `UI` components are mostly done
using the `VEvent` type class. Only the `Storage` component works with `Event` type class.

.Class Diagram for Schedule
image::schedule_class_diagram.png[]

==== Schedule Add Command

===== Implementation

The following is a detailed explanation which `EventAddCommand` performs.

*Step 1:* The `EventAddCommand#execute(Model model)` method is called which validates if the `VEvent` object from
the parser is valid.

*Step 2:* The method `Model#addVEvent(VEvent vEvent)` is then called which adds the new `VEvent` to the `EventHistory`.
The `VEvent` is validated to check if it is unique using the `EventUtil#isEqualVEvent(VEvent vEvent)` method.

*Step 3:* If the event is invalid, a `CommandException` will throw an error message. Else, a new `CommandResult` will
be returned with the success message.

*Step 4:* The `LogicManager` then calls the `Storage#saveEvents(ReadOnlyEvents readOnlyEvents)` which saves the
`EventHistory` in JSON format after serializing it using the `JsonEventStorage`.
[NOTE]
The `ReadOnlyEvents` and `ReadOnlyVEvents` interfaces are an abstraction of the implementation of the `EventHistory`
from other layers of the application.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `schedule add` command:

.Activity Diagram for ScheduleAddCommand
image::ScheduleAddActivityDiagram.png[]

===== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Command Clarity
* *Current Implementation:*
** `schedule add eventName/Consultation startDateTime/2020-04-08T09:00 endDateTime/2020-04-08T11:00 recur/none color/13`

** We currently have full names for prefixes such as eventName/ instead of name/, as well as slightly lengthier prefixes such as
startDateTime/ and endDateTime/. Although this may be slightly more tedious, we believe that it is clearer as there are other
very similar prefixes in our other features such as name/ and date/.

* *Alternatives Considered:*
** `schedule add name/Consultation startDateTime/2020-04-08T09:00 endDateTime/2020-04-08T11:00 recur/none color/13`

** By doing this, users may be confused as the Academics feature, Student feature and Notes feature require name as a prefix
as well. Furthermore, the name required here is not the name of the student but the name of the event.

//end::schedule-featureA[]

=== Logging
This section describes how TeaPet record it's logs.

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
